			In smart contracts, privileged functions controlled by a single account pose a high risk, 
            as they can lead to system compromise through the theft of a single administrator's key. 
            This vulnerability underscores the importance of safeguarding such critical functions from unauthorized access.

			Implementing multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets for controlling privileged functions 
            offers a robust solution to this security challenge. 
            By requiring consensus among multiple authorized parties before executing sensitive transactions, 
            multi-sig mechanisms significantly mitigate the risk of system destruction 
            due to the compromise of a single administrator's key.
